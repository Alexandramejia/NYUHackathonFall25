The Project Frontend (App.jsx and App.css) has a chatbox with an ability to send images and it sends images to yet to be built flask server "/classify.image".
The flask server than responds with e.x.: "low risk" and generates a LLM promt sent to ANything LLM API the LLM text response is then displayed in the chat. 

What needs to be done: the flask backend app.py need image classification logic and execution 
Anything LLM api requires a running instance and implement the backend logic.
